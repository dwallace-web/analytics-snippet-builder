# analytics-snippet-builder
This is a basic repository to enable business teams to generate snippets for analytics environments. This basic tool will generate standardized outputs given a seris of inputs.

The items are generated using basic concatenation. The most current version added usecases for ACDL and Google Data Layer.

This is a demo only and is not designed to work in a production analytics environment. Site developers should be consulted to create unique usecases for the relevant teams.
